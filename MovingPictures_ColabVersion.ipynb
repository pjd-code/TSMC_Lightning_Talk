On these data, the quality plots (prior to quality filtering) suggest a reasonable choice is in the 115 to 130 sequence position range. This is a subjective assessment. One situation where you might deviate from that recommendation is when performing a meta-analysis across multiple sequencing runs. In this type of meta-analysis, it is critical that the read lengths be the same for all of the sequencing runs being compared to avoid introducing a study-specific bias. Since we already using a trim length of 120 for qiime dada2 denoise-single, and since 120 is reasonable given the quality plots, we’ll pass --p-trim-length 120.

        "QIIME 2’s diversity analyses are available through the q2-diversity plugin, which supports computing alpha and beta diversity metrics, applying related statistical tests, and generating interactive visualizations. We’ll first apply the core-metrics-phylogenetic method, which rarefies a FeatureTable[Frequency] to a user-specified depth, computes several alpha and beta diversity metrics, and generates principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots using Emperor for each of the beta diversity metrics. The metrics computed by default are:\n",

        "An important parameter that needs to be provided to this script is --p-sampling-depth, which is the even sampling (i.e. rarefaction) depth. Because most diversity metrics are sensitive to different sampling depths across different samples, this script will randomly subsample the counts from each sample to the value provided for this parameter. For example, if you provide --p-sampling-depth 500, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500. If the total count for any sample(s) are smaller than this value, those samples will be dropped from the diversity analysis. Choosing this value is tricky. We recommend making your choice by reviewing the information presented in the table.qzv file that was created above. Choose a value that is as high as possible (so you retain more sequences per sample) while excluding as few samples as possible."

At each sampling depth step, 10 rarefied tables will be generated, and the diversity metrics will be computed for all samples in the tables. The number of iterations (rarefied tables computed at each sampling depth) can be controlled with --p-iterations. Average diversity values will be plotted for each sample at each even sampling depth, and samples can be grouped based on metadata in the resulting visualization if sample metadata is provided with the --m-metadata-file parameter.\n",

If many of the samples in a group have lower total frequencies than d, the average diversity presented for that group at d in the top plot will be unreliable because it will have been computed on relatively few samples.
